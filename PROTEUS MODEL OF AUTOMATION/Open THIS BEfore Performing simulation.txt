Hello there,

Instructions:

Step-1:

Before opening the Proteus file for the simulation of the model that we have created, please open "WMS_AUTOMATION_RELAY.ino"
Arduino code file and Compile it.

Step-2:

After Compiling it, Copy the directory path of the file where it is saved , (usually path is found in the compile window ending 
with".elf")

Step-3:
After copying it, open the proteus model(do not run the model directly) and double click the arduino Uno and copy the path 
to the "hex file" section in the Dialog box), after this click apply and okay.

Step-4:
Now run the model and here the relay is attached to pin -6 , So press "F" for speeding fast the motor and "f" to lower the speed
of the motor.

thank you.
